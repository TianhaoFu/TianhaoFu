- 👋 Hi, I’m TianhaoFu@PKU. <!-- - Ex-Intern@Baidu, Tencent, Alibaba, Sea, Msra. -->
- 👀 I’m interested in data-centric AI and Quantitative Finance.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data-centric AI. Check my 2022's data-centric AI work: [Tiny3D: a data-centric AI based 3D object detection service production system](https://github.com/TinyDataML/Tiny3D).
 Also, I have done research on **High-frequency Strategy, Mid-frequency Strategy, and Alternative Strategy in US stock, A-share stock, and crypto**. <!-- -  Other work I have been involved in: [FAFE-Net(MM'21)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3474085.3475277), [REDet(ACCV'22 oral)](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ACCV2022/papers/Xu_Boosting_Dense_Long-Tailed_Object_Detection_from_Data-Centric_View_ACCV_2022_paper.pdf), MonoLT(ICASSP'23). -->
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data-centric AI(data privacy, data programming, data simulation, data compression, data duration, data centric ai system) and **Quantitative Finance(job or other opportunities)**.
